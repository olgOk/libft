**What is libft**
-----------------------
Libft is an individual project at 42 Silicon Valley that requires us to re-code some C Standart Library functions including some additional. When developing this library I gained a very deep and thorough understanding in the C  Programming Language along with the great understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.
